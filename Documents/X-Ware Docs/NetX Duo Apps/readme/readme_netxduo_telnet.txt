                                                   is not defined and the Telnet Server needs a packet pool to send Telnet options. 

                                             Created _nx_telnet_server_packet_pool_set() API for applications to set the Telnet Server packet
                                                   pool if NX_TELNET_SERVER_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL is defined.  The default is the Telnet Server
                                                   creates the packet pool.

                                             Cleared socket resource when telnet server is stopped. 
 
                                             Modified nx_telnet_server_process_options to move the offset for all responses to the ECHO request.

                                             Fixed compiler warnings.
                                          
            nxd_telnet_server.h              Added support for for external packet pool creation with configuration option 
                                                   NX_TELNET_SERVER_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL and API nx_telnet_server_packet_pool_set().
                                                   
                                             Unified ticks per second.

                                             Fixed a bug that connection end callback function was not invoked.
                                             Added logic to handle a RST where the socket is already closed.
                                             Added a callback to set remote echo (used by the NetX Duo SHELL Telnet driver).

                                                   NetX Duo Telnet Server calls the disconnect callback. Previously, it simply
                                                   closed the connection silently.

                                             Added a current open connection counter and new API 
                                                   nx_telnet_server_get_open_connection_count for retrieving the open conneciton count.
