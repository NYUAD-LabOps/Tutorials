                                                    registered with the DNS Client, and nx_dns_info_by_name_get() which gets the
                                                    Service record associated with the specified host name.  These services sere

                                                    size can not store the all name string. 

                                                    Change the internal nxd_* function and nxd_* variables to nx_* function and nx_* variables.                                                
    
                                                    Added DNS CACHE feature.
